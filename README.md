# **UX**
## User Stories

__Applicable to all users__


__Returning Users__


## Strategy
----------------
__Project goals__


__User goals__ 



__Industry Research__



## Scope 
----------------



## Structure
----------------

The structure of the page is formed around a single page scrolling design, with fixed sticky navbar that collapses to burger menu on 
tablet and desktop. The website is split into five separate sections, that are simple to navigate and clear to understand.

1. **Landing Page**
- 
2. **Brief Page**
- 
3. **Information Architecture**

## Skeleton 
----------------
### **Wireframes** ###

The Skeleton of the project design was built utilising [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design-systems/). 
A detailed design breakdown can be seen [here.]()
The overall basic design breakpoints can be seen below:

The individual wireframes can be seen by following the links below:
- [xs]()
- [sm]()
- [md]()
- [lg]()
- [xl]()

### **Changes to initial wireframes** ###
A number of design edits were made throughout the project with the purpose of increased userability.

**Typography**

- The font used for both body and headings is [Lato
Designed by ≈Åukasz Dziedzic](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato). This font was chosen for its clarity and modern feel.
The font is utilsed significantly in web design and I wanted the user to feel that the site was of high standard and relatively familiar.
The site also has 'Sans Serif' as an alternative font.

# **Technologies**
## Languages
---------------
For this project two languages were used:
- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/#:~:text=HTML%20is%20the%20standard%20markup,learn%20%2D%20You%20will%20enjoy%20it!)
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)

## Libraries, Frameworks and Technologies
---------------
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap was used to for its wasy to use grid and repsonsive layout. Elelments of the navbar, cards and forms were taken from the Bootstrap V5.0 CDN.

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Figma was used to create initial design and wireframes for different breakpoints.

- [Logomakr](https://logomakr.com) - The fictional brand logo was created on 'LogoMakr'.

- [Coolors](https://coolors.co) - Used to create colour palette and test colour themes.

- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) - Used to source high quality images.

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Google font 'Lato' was included in the project.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - All icons used throughout the project come from fontawesome.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Used for aspects of userability.

- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) - Leaflet was used for the map in the contact section. Due to my lacking experience with JavaScript, this had to be imported and edited to suit the loction of this project.

- [Maptiler Cloud](https://cloud.maptiler.com/maps/streets/) - Leaflet uses maptiler cloud to tile the map view.

- [Mock-Up Generator](https://techsini.com/multi-mockup/index.php) - Used for title photo.

## Workspace and Version Control
--------------------
- [Github](https://github.com/) - The project is hosted on Github and the live website is worked through Github pages.

- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) - The project used Gitpod IDE for build and development. 

# **Testing**
## Code Validators 
---------------
A number of code validation techniques were utilised to ensure proper testing of site. 
For HTML and CSS, I used the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org) and [W3C CSS Validation Services](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). 
These tests returned no errors. See below for results.

- [HTML Test]()
- [CSS Test]()

A Chrome Developer Tools "Lighthouse" Test was aslo completed to test for accessibility and performance. 
The results are seen below. Initial testing showed a low value of SEO and accessibility. This was rectified by 
adding missing alt labels and adding a meta description. Although, the accessibility number is still below 90,
this is an area I wish to improve on going forward with the design of the site.

## Responsive Elements 
--------------

The responsivity of the page was tested primarily using [Google Chrome Dev Tools]() and manual resizing of windows. The test provided positive results for each 
device option. The responsive breakpoints and resizing worked throughout the site. The site was shared with colleagues and friends and tested 
on their devices. An error on IOS with images was found through these tests. A fix for that problem is referred to in the relevant section below.

Other tools utilised to test responsivity are seen here:
- [Screenfly](https://bluetree.ai/screenfly/) - [Result]()
- [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com) - [Result]()
  

## UX User Story Test
--------------
The user stories previously laid out in the UX Design section are tested, to ensure that project achieves the user goals.
